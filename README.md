# genetic_algorithm_examples
Multi purpose class for genetic algorithms and examples


- Evolutionary programming:
    - Generations of candidates are proposed to solve the problem on each generation and they are made to evolve
    
- Genetic programming:
    - Those generations copulate together to breed a new generation of fitter individuals
    - Only the fittest survive
    - Some random mutation occur
    
- Metaheuristic
    - Formalised heuristics
    - Controlled application depending on the problem
    - e.g. mutating an individual could be shuffling its "genes" (coordinates) or slightly modify one or several of them
    
- Advantages
    - Scaled for high dimensional problems
    - Hardly falls into local minimas
    - Supports arbitrary constraints
    
- Drawdowns
    - No real insurance on you've reached a sharp result
    - Can seem long in low dimensions
    - Calibrating the model can seem arbitrary
    - No real genericity
